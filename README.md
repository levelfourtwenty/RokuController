# RokuController
A simple cli controller for Roku devices that utilizes the roku external control API.

# What is this program and how do I use it?
This program takes Keyboard input from a user when ran, it allows for entry of words, navigation around applications via any computer on the same network as the device, I decided to develop it as I saw a lack of programs to control roku devices via a computer.
